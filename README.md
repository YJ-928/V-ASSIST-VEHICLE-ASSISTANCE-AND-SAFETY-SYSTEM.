# V-ASSIST: VEHICLE ASSISTANCE AND SAFETY SYSTEM.
## A KSCST(Karnataka State Council for Science and Technology) Funded Project.

### Abstract:
Traffic accidents are becoming more common and serious as civilization has progressed and car sales have increased dramatically. Simultaneously, with both the rapid progress of science and technology, automobile industry has evolved as well, with vehicle safety technology gradually becoming integrated into all areas of the vehicle.
It has been pointed that most of the accidents on the roads are caused by driver faults, inattention and low performance. Increasing stress levels in drivers, along with their ability to multi task with infotainment systems cause the drivers to deviate their attention from the primary task of driving. Hence much emphasis is being given to occupant safety.
Although there are several different implementations of safety systems with different operation conditions, the development of an active safety system inventory becomes a useful tool for experts to have a feel for the generic system, project the functionality of such a system onto available data collected, and, most relevantly, assess if somehow the system completely meets the needs of drivers.
It is critical to comprehend the complete functioning of the system, taking into the consideration, as many design aspects as possible, and incorporate past assessment research when analyzing how safety systems serve drivers' expectations, resulting in an appraisal of total benefit.
There is a trend by automakers to gradually add technologies that collaborate with drivers both in driving and maintaining the car itself, such as: Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS), Electronic Stability Control (ESC), Lane Departure Warning (LDW), Left Turn Crash Warning (LTCW), Collision Warning System (CWS), Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB), High Speed Warning (HSW), Curve Speed Warning (CSW), Blind Spot Detection (BSD) and Road Sign Recognition (RSR).
It is critical to comprehend the complete functioning of the system, taking into the consideration, as many design aspects as possible, and incorporate past assessment research when analyzing how safety systems serve drivers' expectations, resulting in an appraisal of total benefit. There are four primary features of active safety system – Adaptive Cruise Control, Emergency Braking System, Blind Spot Detection and Lane Assistance System.

### Introduction:
Bearing in mind that car accidents are the 8th leading cause of death globally, and 95% of the accidents are caused by human error, the expectation is that transport automation will represent a significant reduction in the number of occurrences and, mainly, of victims.
Although it is still in its infancy, autonomous driving technology is becoming increasingly common and could radically transform our transport system.
Different cars are capable of varying levels of autonomy: Level 0: humans control all significant systems.
Level 1: specific systems, such as cruise control or automatic braking, can be
controlled by the vehicle, one at a time.
Level 2: the vehicle offers at least two simultaneous automatic functions,
such as acceleration and steering, but requires human beings for safe operation.
Level 3: the vehicle can manage all critical safety functions under certain
conditions, but the driver must take over when alerted.
Level 4: the vehicle is fully autonomous in some driving scenarios, although
not all.
Level 5: the vehicle is fully capable of autonomy in all situations.
Artificial Intelligence today, using computer vision and other methods, allows the vehicles to differentiate the types of obstacles and situations on the roads so as not only to react according to pre-established parameters but also to learn eventualities.
There is a trend by automakers to gradually add technologies that collaborate with drivers both in driving and maintaining the car itself, such as: Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS), Electronic Stability Control (ESC), Lane Departure Warning (LDW), Left Turn Crash Warning (LTCW), Collision Warning System (CWS), Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB), High Speed Warning (HSW), Curve Speed Warning (CSW), Blind Spot Detection (BSD) and Road Sign Recognition (RSR).
Traditionally Automobile Safety Systems can be classified in to two segments:
• Active Safety Systems: as the term suggests play a preventive role in mitigating crashes and accidents by providing advance warning or by providing the driver with additional assistance in steering/controlling the vehicle.
• Passive Safety Systems: They play a role in limiting/containing the damage/injuries caused to driver, passengers and pedestrians in the event of a crash/accident. Airbags, Seatbelts, Whiplash Protection System etc. are common Passive Safety Systems deployed in vehicles these days.
Autonomous vehicles can be further distinguished as connected or not, indicating whether they can communicate with other vehicles and with the city’s infrastructure, such as the next generation of traffic lights and traffic management in cities.
